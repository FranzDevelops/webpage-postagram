# Postagram Landing Page

Postagram is a web platform-based software for graphic design that uses AI as its core motor. It makes designing beautiful creative assets easy for everyone, from social media images, videos, and gifs to posters, websites, booklets, multimedia presentations, and more. Postagram is an invaluable tool for helping designers level up their design skills as an accessible tool.
## Technologies

Postagram Landing Page is built using Astro and CSS.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ Layout/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ affiliate.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ contact.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ faq.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
